# Field Recoring Notes

These are my own notes on my field recording hobby. I decided to kickstart 2025 with a new hobby that gets me out of the house.

## gear

Just to keep notes on my equipment, since I am just starting out, this keeps me off of getting too enthousiastic about it and getting more stuff before I am sufficiently experienced with what I already have.

Note that the equipment I am using has been selected by what I can put my hands on easily where I live specifically, while also trying to keep costs low. This list is really for my own use.

- Tascam DR-05X, a handheld recorder that uses 3.5mm TRS connector for external microphone.
- Tourmate Hard Case for DR-05X, helps me transport things in a compact Case
- 4 Toshiba rechargeable batteries, its the same battery type I use around the house for gameboy and remotes.
- Ulanzi Mt-16, a small and portable tripod
- Senheiser MKE 200, a small and portable microphone
- Windshield for the Tascam DR-05X microphones, the cheapest I found
- sony mdr xb55ap, earbuds for listening directly from the Tascam DR-05X
- 1 64 GB Sandisk micro SD card, I will probably need more in the future, but I will need to figure a way to store them.

So as you see, it's all built around the very small Tascam DR-05X, it's a small and very portable kit I can throw in a small backpack that doesn't calls much attention and also its quick to assembly and have it recording.

Overtime my goal as I gain more understanding of it is to have an additional, XLR based kit, for more professional recordings, but right now I will see (listen?) what I can get with what I have.

## software

My plan here, for editing, is to rely solely on Audacity. I have used it for more than ten years now and am confident my needs here are small enough it can do well.

For sound organizing, I may build something myself at some point - probably using either PyQt or some custom c++ thing.

## places

For now I am mostly recording in places near where I live, so I don't plan to write about these. In the future when traveling, I may make notes on places I traveled to and captured sounds.
